# Covid 19 Detection Using Symptoms
### Objectives
- To train a model to predict Covid-19 positive or negative based on  symptoms.
-  To minimize the chance of Positive person is  being classified as Negative (i.e minimizing False positive   < 5 ).
-  Implementing machine learning model for classifying the records in the  dataset correctly, consistently and time efficiently.

### Instructions
1. Import data and Covid-19 detection.ipynb (Python source file) and run on jupyter
2. Predict the outcome using the code
